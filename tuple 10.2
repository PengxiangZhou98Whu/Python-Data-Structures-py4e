10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = input("Enter file:")
try:
    handle = open(name)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    line=line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From '):
        words=line.split()
        if len(words)>=6:
            time = words[5]
            tm=time.split(':')
            hour = tm[0]
            counts[hour] = counts.get(hour, 0) + 1
lst = []
for k,v  in counts.items():
    lst.append((k,v))
lst = sorted(lst)
for k, v in lst :
    print(k, v)
    
#shorter-version
#c = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
#print( sorted( [ (v,k) for k,v in c.items() ] ) )
#[(1, 'b'), (10, 'a'), (22, 'c')]
