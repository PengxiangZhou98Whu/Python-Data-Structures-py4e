9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = input("Enter file:")
try:
    handle = open(name)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
counts = dict()
email = list()
for line in handle:
    line=line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From '):
        words=line.split()
        if len(words)>=2:
            email.append(words[1])            
for em in email:
    counts[em] = counts.get(em, 0) + 1
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in counts.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigword = word
        bigcount = count
print(bigword, bigcount)
